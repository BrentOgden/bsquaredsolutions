## What actually drives cost

1. **Scope & pages**
   - More page layouts and content → more design/dev time.
   - Revisions also add time (plan 1–2 rounds per milestone).

2. **Design depth**
   - Brand system, custom components, animation, and illustration can add **20–40%**.

3. **Features & integrations**
   - CMS, bookings, payments, CRM, email marketing, membership areas.
   - Custom API work is typically the highest-variance line item.

4. **Content & SEO**
   - Copywriting, on-page SEO, technical SEO, redirects, schema, image optimization.

5. **Performance & accessibility**
   - Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP), WCAG AA checks, responsive QA.

## One-time vs ongoing costs

- **One-time**: design + build, migrations, integrations.
- **Ongoing**: hosting, domains, maintenance, content, analytics, A/B testing.

**Typical monthly** (post-launch):
- Hosting & CDN: **$10–$40**
- Premium plugins/APIs: **$0–$100**
- Maintenance & updates: **$99–$300+** (depends on cadence)

## How to keep budgets on track

- **Define measurable goals** (leads, sales, bookings).
- **Prioritize pages**: *Must-Have* vs *Nice-to-Have* vs *Future*.
- **Lock requirements** (forms, CMS rules, integrations) before development.
- **Batch revisions** to reduce churn.
