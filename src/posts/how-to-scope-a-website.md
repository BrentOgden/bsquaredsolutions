**Most websites stall because the scope is fuzzy.** A great website scope turns big ideas into clear requirements tied to outcomes—leads, sales, bookings, or sign-ups. Use this practical framework to keep your project on schedule and focused on ROI.

## How to define your scope

1. **Start with measurable goals**
   - Tie the site to one or two business outcomes (e.g., increase demo requests by **25%**, reduce support tickets by **15%**).
   - **KPI examples:** conversion rate, qualified leads, average order value, trial sign-ups.
   - Pair each KPI with a tracking plan (**Analytics + events**).

2. **Define audiences and key journeys**
   - Identify your primary users and what they need to accomplish in **2–3 clicks**.
   - **Journeys to map:**
     - Homepage → Service → Contact
     - Product → Pricing → Checkout
     - Blog → Lead Magnet → Demo

3. **Prioritize pages and content**
   - Create a page inventory and mark each as **Must-Have**, **Nice-to-Have**, or **Future**.
   - **Common pages:** Home, Services, Pricing, About, Case Studies, Blog, Contact.
   - For each page, capture: **goal**, **key message**, **primary CTA**, **success metric**.

4. **Lock functional requirements early**
   - List required features and integrations:
     - Forms (with notifications + spam controls)
     - CMS (what needs to be editable)
     - eCommerce, payments, bookings, CRM, email marketing
     - Performance and accessibility targets (**Core Web Vitals**, **WCAG AA**)

5. **Set visual & brand direction**
   - Collect **3–5 example sites** and **4–6 style words** (e.g., *modern, minimal, bold, trustworthy*) to accelerate design alignment.

6. **Establish budget, timeline, and risks**
   - Provide a realistic range and a target date.
   - Flag risks early (late content, new brand, complex integrations).

7. **Handoff as a one-page scope**
   - Deliver a concise brief including: goals, audiences, journeys, pages, features, CMS rules, integrations, SEO basics, analytics, risks, and timeline.
