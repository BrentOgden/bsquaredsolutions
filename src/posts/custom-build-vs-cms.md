> **TL;DR:**  
> - Pick **Custom** when you need unique UX, complex logic, or maximum performance.  
> - Pick a **CMS** when speed-to-market, simple publishing, and budget control matter most.  
> - Hybrid options exist (e.g., headless CMS + custom front end) if you want both flexibility and an editor-friendly workflow.

## The core question

Ask: **“What will this site need to do _12 months_ from now?”**  
If your roadmap includes bespoke flows (dashboards, gated content, unusual product rules), **custom** likely wins. If the primary job is publishing content fast with minimal engineering, **CMS** is the safe, scalable choice.

---

## When a **Custom Build** shines

- **Unique UX or workflows:** Booking logic, pricing calculators, multi-step forms, custom dashboards.  
- **Performance as a feature:** Lighthouse 90+ targets, critical landing pages, heavy SEO competition.  
- **Scalability & ownership:** No theme/plugin bloat; codebase tailored to your stack and infra.  
- **Security posture:** Smaller attack surface than a plugin-heavy CMS.

**Typical stack:** React + Tailwind CSS (+ API layer), optional headless CMS for content.

---

## When a **CMS** is the better move

- **Editorial velocity:** Teams publishing often, non-technical authors, scheduled posts, roles & permissions.  
- **Speed to market:** Launch in weeks using a solid theme and a few plugins.  
- **E-commerce basics:** Standard catalogs, carts, and checkout (e.g., Shopify).  
- **Budget control:** Lower initial build + predictable add-ons.

**Common picks:** WordPress (flexible publishing), Shopify (commerce), Duda (turnkey + fast setup).

---

## Hidden costs to watch

- **Plugins & themes:** Ongoing subscription fees; compatibility and update risk.  
- **Maintenance drift:** Unused plugins, fragile theme customizations, slow creeping bloat.  
- **Complex integrations:** Even on CMS, custom integrations cost time and testing.  
- **Content migration:** Restructuring pages, redirects, media cleanup take longer than expected.

## A quick decision matrix

| Priority                           | Custom Build | CMS |
|-----------------------------------|:------------:|:---:|
| Unique features / custom logic    |     ✅✅     |  ⚠️  |
| Content team autonomy             |      ⚠️      | ✅✅ |
| Time to launch                    |      ⚠️      | ✅✅ |
| Long-term performance control     |     ✅✅     |  ⚠️  |
| Upfront budget sensitivity        |      ⚠️      | ✅✅ |
| Security (reduced plugin surface) |     ✅✅     |  ⚠️  |

> **Legend:** ✅✅ = strong fit, ⚠️ = possible with trade-offs.

## Hybrid: the best of both

Use a **headless CMS** (e.g., Contentful, Sanity, WordPress headless) to let editors manage content, and render a **custom React** front end for speed, control, and design freedom. This adds complexity, but you get:
- Editor-friendly authoring
- Fast, modern UI
- Cleaner separation of concerns

---

## Implementation cheatsheet

**If you choose Custom:**
- Define critical user flows & KPIs first.
- Establish a component library/design system early.
- Budget for analytics, SEO, accessibility, and handoff docs.

**If you choose CMS:**
- Start with the leanest set of plugins possible.
- Lock a content model (post types, taxonomies) before content import.
- Schedule monthly updates + security monitoring.

## What we recommend

We start with a **requirements workshop** to map goals, content volume, future features, and budget. Then we propose:
- **Custom Build** for advanced UX, bespoke features, or high-stakes performance.
- **CMS** for editorial speed and straightforward sites.
- **Hybrid** when both content velocity and custom UX are must-haves.
