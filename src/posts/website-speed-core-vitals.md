**Faster sites convert better and rank higher.** Core Web Vitals measure real-world UX: **LCP** (load), **CLS** (layout shift), and **INP** (interaction).

---

## 1) Optimize images (biggest win)

- Serve modern formats (AVIF/WEBP) with responsive sizes.
- Lazy-load below-the-fold images.
- Compress aggressively while keeping clarity.

**Checklist**
- [ ] 'srcset' + sizes set  
- [ ] Lazy-load non-critical images  
- [ ] Use AVIF/WEBP where supported  

---

## 2) CSS & JS strategy

- Inline **critical CSS**; defer the rest.
- Split vendor code; load non-critical scripts 'defer'/'async'.
- Remove unused CSS/JS and third-party bloat.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Critical CSS extracted  
- [ ] Defer/async non-critical JS  
- [ ] Audit third-party scripts quarterly  

---

## 3) Caching & delivery

- Use a CDN; enable compression (Brotli) and HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.
- Cache HTML for anonymous users where possible.
- Preload key assets (fonts, hero image) responsibly.

---

## 4) Layout stability (CLS)

- Always reserve space for images/ads/embeds using width/height or aspect-ratio.
- Avoid late-loading fonts that shift text—use 'font-display: swap;'.

---

## 5) Interaction responsiveness (INP)

- Keep main thread light (avoid heavy synchronous tasks).
- Debounce input handlers; use web workers for expensive work.

---

## Verify & iterate

Run **PageSpeed Insights** and **Lighthouse** regularly. Fix the worst offenders first. Re-test after each change.

**Bottom line:** Aim for a fast, stable, interactive experience—your users (and your conversion rate) will thank you.
