Redesigns are when good SEO dies—usually from broken URLs, missing metadata, or slow new templates. Here’s a battle-tested plan to **preserve rankings and traffic** while you launch faster pages and a better UX.

## Phase 1 — Benchmark & audit (before any pixels move)

- **Baseline KPIs**: organic sessions, impressions, clicks, rankings, conversions.  
- **Full crawl** of the current site (Screaming Frog/Sitebulb) and export:  
  - URLs, titles, meta descriptions, canonicals  
  - H1/H2s, internal links, status codes  
  - Image alts, structured data, indexability  
- **Content inventory**: flag keep / improve / consolidate.

## Phase 2 — URL strategy & information architecture

- Keep **permalinks stable** where possible.  
- If a URL must change, create a **one-to-one 301** map (no chains).  
- Maintain **keyword intent** and internal link context.

> Pro tip: avoid '/blog/awesome-post' → '/insights/awesome-post-v2'. If the topic is the same, keep the URL and update the content.

## Phase 3 — On-page SEO parity (don’t lose what already works)

- Unique **title tags** and **meta descriptions** ported over.  
- One **H1** per page; heading hierarchy preserved.  
- Critical copy retained (don’t remove ranking sections).  
- **Alt text** for images; **schema** where applicable (FAQ, Article, Product).  
- **Canonical** tags reflect the new truth.

## Phase 4 — Performance & Core Web Vitals (make it faster)

- **Ship lighter**: compress images (AVIF/WEBP), lazy-load below the fold, tree-shake JS.  
- **CSS strategy**: purge unused CSS; inline critical above-the-fold styles.  
- **Measure**: run Lighthouse + PageSpeed Insights on templates; fix LCP/CLS/INP before launch.

## Phase 5 — Pre-launch QA on staging

- Block indexing on staging ('robots' noindex) but allow authenticated crawling for tests.  
- Crawl staging with the **redirect map applied** (simulate final URLs).  
- Validate structured data, canonicals, hreflang (if used).  
- Test key journeys: Home → Service → Contact, Product → Checkout, Blog → Lead.

## Phase 6 — Launch day checklist

- Remove staging noindex; **submit XML sitemap**.  
- Re-verify domain in **Search Console**; keep disavow (if you use one).  
- Push the **301 redirect file** (no temporary 302s).  
- Verify analytics tags, conversions, and goals.  
- Spot-check top organic landing pages for parity.

## Phase 7 — Post-launch monitoring (first 2–4 weeks)

- **Daily**: 404s, server errors, unexpected 302s; fix quickly.  
- **Weekly**: performance (LCP/CLS/INP), index coverage, sitemap status, ranking deltas.  
- **Ongoing**: improve internal links to priority pages; update old redirects that chain.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Deleting thin but **internally linked** pages without redirecting equivalents.  
- “Fresh design” that adds **heavy JS** and tanks Core Web Vitals.  
- Changing URL paths **and** titles **and** content **and** IA—too many variables at once.  
- Forgetting canonicals on paginated or parameterized pages.

## Copy/paste templates

**Redirect map (CSV):**
```csv
from_url,to_url,type
/old-service,/services/new-service,301
/old-post,/blog/new-post,301
```
##
**Meta parity audit (columns):**
```txt
URL | Old Title | New Title | Old Meta | New Meta | Canonical | H1 | Notes
```

## Tools we like

- **Screaming Frog** / **Sitebulb** for crawling  
- **Search Console** for coverage & queries  
- **PageSpeed Insights** for Core Web Vitals  
- **Ahrefs / Semrush** for keyword and link checks

> Redesigns are the perfect moment to upgrade speed, accessibility, and UX—without giving up hard-won rankings.
