Should you **DIY a template** or invest in a **custom website**? Here’s a clear, business-first comparison.

## Snapshot comparison

| Factor | DIY Template | Custom Build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed to launch** | Fast (days) | Moderate (weeks) |
| **Upfront cost** | Low | Higher |
| **Flexibility** | Limited by theme | Unlimited (fits your brand/process) |
| **Performance** | Varies by theme | Tuned for Core Web Vitals |
| **SEO** | Basic | Structured + technical SEO baked in |
| **Integrations** | Limited | Anything needed (APIs, CRM, automations) |
| **Maintenance** | You manage | Shared or agency-managed |

## When DIY fits

- You need to **validate** an idea quickly.
- You have **simple content** and a single CTA.
- You’re comfortable doing light edits and updates.

**Risks:** generic design, plugin bloat, slower pages, limited scalability.

---

## When custom is worth it

- You need **differentiation** and a branded UX.
- Complex features: bookings, gated content, membership, multi-step forms.
- You want **long-term SEO** and fast performance.

**Upside:** better conversion rate, easier growth, fewer rebuilds later.

---

## A hybrid path (popular)

Launch with a **professional template** and a limited set of pages, then evolve into **custom components** as you grow. You get speed now and flexibility later.
