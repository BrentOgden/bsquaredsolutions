**SEO doesn’t have to be mysterious.** Nail the basics and you’ll capture qualified traffic without chasing algorithms.

---

## 1) Site structure & crawlability

- Clean navigation and logical hierarchy (Home → Services → Service Detail → Contact).
- XML sitemap and robots.txt configured.
- Descriptive, human-readable URLs (e.g., `/services/web-design`).

**Checklist**
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console  
- [ ] Robots.txt allows indexing of public pages  
- [ ] Breadcrumbs implemented where helpful  

---

## 2) On-page SEO

- **Titles**: 50–60 chars, primary keyword near the front.
- **Meta descriptions**: 140–160 chars, compelling value prop + CTA.
- **Headings**: One H1 per page; use H2/H3 to structure subtopics.
- **Copy**: Write for people first—clarity, benefits, and specifics.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Unique title + meta per page  
- [ ] One H1; semantic H2/H3  
- [ ] Internal links to related pages  
- [ ] Image `alt` attributes  

---

## 3) Technical SEO & performance

- Pass Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP).
- Mobile-friendly layout, responsive images (`srcset`/lazy-load where appropriate).
- 301 redirects for moved content; avoid 404 chains.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights audit  
- [ ] Redirect map (old → new URLs)  
- [ ] Schema markup (Org, LocalBusiness, Product, Article)  

---

## 4) Local SEO (for service areas)

- Consistent **NAP** (Name, Address, Phone) everywhere.
- Google Business Profile fully completed: categories, hours, services, photos.
- Location pages targeting city/region with unique, useful content.

**Checklist**
- [ ] NAP consistency across listings  
- [ ] Reviews strategy (ask, respond, repeat)  
- [ ] Location landing page(s)  

---

## 5) Content that compels

- Answer real questions buyers ask (how much, how long, what’s included).
- Publish case studies and before/after examples.
- Use schema to enhance visibility (FAQ, HowTo, Article).

**Starter topics**
- Pricing & packages, timelines, process, “best of” comparisons, ROI stories.

---

## Track, test, improve

- Configure Analytics + events (calls, form submits, quotes).
- Monitor Search Console (queries, pages, coverage).
- Iterate monthly (titles, meta, content, internal links).
