Keeping your site fast, secure, and up-to-date is not a one-time task—it’s ongoing work. A **website maintenance plan** prevents costly downtime, protects your brand, and supports SEO and conversions. Here’s exactly **what’s included** in a professional plan (and what usually isn’t) so you can budget with confidence.

## What’s *not* typically included (separate scope)

Even comprehensive plans have limits. These items usually require a **mini-project** or a higher tier:

- Full **redesign** or rebrand, new page templates, or design systems  
- Net-new features (e.g., **custom integrations**, membership, booking apps)  
- Complex content creation (copywriting, photography, video)  
- Marketing campaigns (ads management, landing pages at scale)  
- Large SEO projects (content strategy, digital PR/link building)  
- Data migrations or major CMS/platform changes  
- Enterprise security hardening or penetration testing

> Tip: If you expect regular new features, choose a plan with **monthly dev hours** or add a retainer.
